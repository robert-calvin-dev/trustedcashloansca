  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why Your Bank Hates You</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 19, 2025</strong></p>
  
  <p>
  Your bank smiles in their ads. They say you’re “valued.” They call you a “customer.” But here’s the uncomfortable truth: **if you’re broke, your bank hates you** — and profits off your pain.
  </p>
  
  ---
  
  <h2>The Business Model Is Built to Punish You</h2>
  <p>
  Banks make the most money when you’re struggling:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>$35 overdraft fees</strong> for spending $1 too much</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum balance fees</strong> for not having enough money</li>
    <li><strong>ATM fees</strong> for using your own money outside their tiny network</li>
    <li><strong>Late fees, maintenance fees, hidden fees</strong>... all aimed at people who can least afford them</li>
  </ul>
  
  Meanwhile, wealthy account holders get interest, cashback, and concierge service. You? You get “insufficient funds.”
  </p>
  
  ---
  
  <h2>You’re Not a Customer. You’re a Target.</h2>
  <p>
  If you:
  <ul>
    <li>Live paycheck to paycheck</li>
    <li>Use debit for everyday purchases</li>
    <li>Occasionally overdraft or miss a due date</li>
  </ul>
  …you are not their ideal customer. You are a **profit center**. They don’t want you to succeed. They want you to hover in just enough debt to keep racking up fees — but not enough to leave.
  </p>
  
  ---
  
  <h2>Why Banks Don’t Want You to Leave</h2>
  <p>
  Because inertia is profitable. Switching banks feels hard, so they know most people won’t bother. Meanwhile:
  <ul>
    <li>They hold your money</li>
    <li>They earn interest off your deposits</li>
    <li>They sell your data</li>
  </ul>
  And if you overdraft? They’ll slap you with a fee, then charge you again **every day you’re negative.**
  </p>

  <h2>Modern Alternatives That Don’t Hate You</h2>
  
  <p>If you’re tired of traditional banks bleeding you dry, here are alternatives built for real humans:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chime</strong> – No fees, overdraft protection, early paycheck access</li>
    <li><strong>Current</strong> – Mobile-first, budgeting tools, no minimums</li>
    <li><strong>One Finance</strong> – Auto-savings, no overdraft fees</li>
    <li><strong>Cash App</strong> – Not technically a bank, but still safer than Wells Fargo for many</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These aren’t perfect. But they’re not playing the same rigged game either.</p>
  
  ---
  
  <h2>If You’re Stuck With a Traditional Bank</h2>
  <p>
  Here’s how to fight back:
  <ul>
    <li>Opt out of overdraft “protection” — it’s a trap</li>
    <li>Set up low-balance alerts and auto-transfers</li>
    <li>Use prepaid cards for daily expenses</li>
    <li>Call and ask for every fee to be waived — **yes, every single one**</li>
  </ul>
  
  ---
  
  <h2>Final Word</h2>
  <p>
  You’re not imagining it. Your bank is not your friend. If you feel like you’re getting punished for being broke — it’s because you are.  
  But you can opt out of their game. And you should.  
  Your money deserves better — and so do you.

  <h2>Why Banks Block the People Who Need Help Most</h2>
  <p>“Sorry, your credit score doesn’t qualify.” Sound familiar? You’re not alone. Banks routinely deny loans to the exact people who need help the most—because profit, policy, and outdated systems keep them chained to risk-avoidance over reality. This article exposes why the banking system feels rigged, who it fails, and what short-term loan options actually offer relief when everything else says no.</p>

    <li>How payday loans differ from bank loans</li>
    <li>Emergency cash for people banks reject</li>
    <li>Bank bias against low-income borrowers</li>
    <li>Alternative lending for urgent expenses</li>
    <li>Options when your bank says no</li>
    <li>How to get money fast without a bank</li>
    <li>Denied loan? Here's what to do next</li>
