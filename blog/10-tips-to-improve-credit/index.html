  <h1 style="text-align: center;">10 Proven Tips to Improve Your Credit Score</h1>
<p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 19, 2025</strong></p>

<p>
Your credit score can unlock better loan rates, larger credit limits, and even housing or job opportunities. The good news? Even if your score isn’t great right now, it can be improved. These 10 tips will help you take control and build a stronger financial future — one point at a time.
</p>

<h2>1. Check Your Credit Report (For Free)</h2>
<p>
Start by knowing what lenders see. You’re entitled to one free credit report per year from each of the three bureaus at <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. Look for errors, outdated accounts, or fraudulent activity. Dispute anything incorrect — it could boost your score fast.
</p>

<h2>2. Pay On Time, Every Time</h2>
<p>
Payment history makes up 35% of your FICO score. Even one missed payment can hurt. Set up autopay, text alerts, or calendar reminders to stay on track. If you’ve missed payments in the past, consistency now will still help rebuild trust over time.
</p>

<h2>3. Keep Credit Utilization Below 30%</h2>
<p>
Credit utilization is how much of your available credit you’re using. Example: If you have a $1,000 credit limit, try to keep your balance under $300. Lower utilization = better score. Aim for 10% or less for maximum results.
</p>

<h2>4. Don’t Close Old Accounts</h2>
<p>
Length of credit history counts, so older accounts help your score — even if you don’t use them. Unless there’s a fee, keep them open to show stability and credit age.
</p>

<h2>5. Diversify Your Credit Mix</h2>
<p>
Lenders like to see a healthy mix: credit cards, loans, etc. If you’ve only ever had one type, consider adding something small and manageable — like a secured card or a credit-builder loan.
</p>

<h2>6. Don’t Apply for Too Much at Once</h2>
<p>
Every time you apply for credit, it triggers a “hard inquiry,” which can drop your score temporarily. Limit new applications, especially if you're trying to repair your credit.
</p>

<h2>7. Become an Authorized User</h2>
<p>
Ask a trusted friend or family member with a good credit history to add you as an authorized user on their credit card. Their positive payment history can reflect on your report — even if you never use the card.
</p>

<h2>8. Use a Secured Credit Card</h2>
<p>
If your score is too low to qualify for a traditional card, secured cards are a solid alternative. You pay a deposit, then borrow against it. Use it responsibly, and your score will improve.
</p>

<h2>9. Pay More Than the Minimum</h2>
<p>
Even an extra $20/month on a credit card balance makes a difference. It shows lenders you’re serious about debt reduction and helps lower your credit utilization faster.
</p>

<h2>10. Don’t Ignore Collections</h2>
<p>
Old collection accounts hurt, but paying them off (especially if the lender agrees to delete the item upon payment) can help. Even if the account stays on your report, a paid balance looks better than an open one.
</p>

<h2>Bonus Tip: Monitor Your Progress</h2>
<p>
Use free tools like Credit Karma, NerdWallet, or your bank’s credit score tracker to keep tabs on your progress. Watching your score go up is seriously motivating.
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">
<strong>Rebuilding takes time — but you're not alone.</strong><br>
If you need access to short-term cash while improving your credit, <a href="/" style="color: darkblue; text-decoration: underline;">apply now for a payday or personal installment loan</a>. No score impact to check your options.
