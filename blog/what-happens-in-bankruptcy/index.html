  <h1 style="text-align: center;">What Happens in Bankruptcy?</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 19, 2025</strong></p>
  
  <p>
  Bankruptcy is often seen as a last resort — and for good reason. But it's also a legal tool that exists to help individuals overwhelmed by debt find relief and a way to rebuild. If you're wondering what bankruptcy actually means, how it affects your financial life, and what to expect if you file, this guide breaks it down.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What Is Bankruptcy?</h2>
  <p>
  Bankruptcy is a legal process that allows individuals or businesses to eliminate or repay debts under the protection of the federal bankruptcy court. It’s not just about wiping the slate clean — it’s about reorganizing your finances under court supervision.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Types of Bankruptcy for Individuals</h2>
  <p>
  There are two main types of bankruptcy used by individuals:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chapter 7:</strong> Also known as “liquidation,” this type involves selling non-exempt assets to pay off creditors. Most unsecured debts (like credit cards and medical bills) are discharged.</li>
    <li><strong>Chapter 13:</strong> This type lets you keep your property while repaying part of your debt over a 3- to 5-year plan. It’s ideal for people with regular income who want to avoid foreclosure or repossession.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>How Does Bankruptcy Affect Your Credit?</h2>
  <p>
  Bankruptcy will have a major impact on your credit score:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chapter 7</strong> stays on your credit report for up to 10 years.</li>
    <li><strong>Chapter 13</strong> remains for up to 7 years.</li>
  </ul>
  That doesn’t mean your financial future is ruined — but it does mean lenders will consider you high-risk for a while. That’s why rebuilding credit after bankruptcy is crucial.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What Debts Are Discharged in Bankruptcy?</h2>
  <p>
  Bankruptcy can discharge many types of unsecured debt, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Credit card balances</li>
    <li>Medical bills</li>
    <li>Personal loans</li>
    <li>Utility bills</li>
    <li>Most collection accounts</li>
  </ul>
  However, bankruptcy typically does <strong>not</strong> discharge:
  <ul>
    <li>Student loans (in most cases)</li>
    <li>Child support or alimony</li>
    <li>Recent taxes</li>
    <li>Fines and criminal penalties</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Will I Lose Everything?</h2>
  <p>
  Not necessarily. Each state has exemption laws that protect certain assets like:
  <ul>
    <li>Your primary residence (up to a certain equity limit)</li>
    <li>A personal vehicle</li>
    <li>Household goods and personal items</li>
    <li>Retirement accounts (usually exempt)</li>
  </ul>
  Most Chapter 7 cases are “no asset” cases, meaning you don’t have anything the court can take.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Can I Still Get a Loan After Bankruptcy?</h2>
  <p>
  Yes — but it will be harder and more expensive. Many borrowers start by:
  <ul>
    <li>Getting a secured credit card</li>
    <li>Taking out a credit-builder loan</li>
    <li>Using short-term options like <a href="/paydayloans/">payday loans</a> or <a href="/personalloans/">personal installment loans</a> for urgent expenses</li>
  </ul>
  Some lenders specialize in working with borrowers who have a bankruptcy on their record. Over time, with responsible repayment, you can rebuild your score and qualify for better financial products.
  </p>
  
  <h2>When to Consider Bankruptcy</h2>
  <p>
  Filing for bankruptcy is a serious decision. Consider it if:
  <ul>
    <li>You’re being sued or harassed by creditors</li>
    <li>You’re months behind on major bills</li>
    <li>You have more debt than you could repay in 5 years</li>
    <li>Debt collectors are garnishing your wages</li>
  </ul>
  Always consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney before filing.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
  Bankruptcy isn’t the end — it’s a reset. If you’ve hit financial rock bottom, it’s a chance to get back on your feet. At Trusted Cash Loans, we understand that credit scores don’t tell the whole story. That’s why we work with lenders who look beyond the past to help you find real solutions today.
